### Development workflow

Main Communication tool - https://discord.com/invite/K8Jv6AxEWh
Project management board - https://trello.com/b/mWSn6hJm/assignment-2

Meetings are done in discord voice channels
Before every meeting, prepare for standup questions: 
What have you done?
What are you going to do?
Are there any issues you are facing?

Before starting on a task check project managment board
Assign yourself to task card and move it to doing column when you start on a task
Task cards in Trello can only be moved into done column after live test during meetings
